        <h2>Decription of Tools Used</h2>
        
        <h3>Vue.js</h3>
        <p>
            Vue.js is an open-source model–view–viewmodel frontend JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue.js was used in the project to create a dynamic UI to filter crime data, which then is used to create the table & update the map with the specified filters.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Leaflet</h3>
        <p>
            Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for creating mobile-friendly interactive maps. Leaflet was used in the project to create a map with crime data overlayed on top of it. Additionally, Leaflet is used to show the boundaries of the various neighborhoods within St. Paul.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Nominatim</h3>
        <p>
            Nominatim is a tool to search Open Street Map (OSM) data by name and address (geocoding) and to generate synthetic addresses of OSM points (reverse geocoding). In the project, Nominatim is used to convert addresses to latitude/longitude in order to place points on the Leaflet map of the St. Paul crime data.
